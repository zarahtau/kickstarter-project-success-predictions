# Kickstarter Project Success Predictions

## Abstract
As one of the leading crowdfunding platforms, Kickstarter brings creative projects to life. Creators come forward with innovative ideas and backers fund their developement. Given a deadline, if the creator receives full funding for their idea, they are able to 'kickstart' their project. However, given millions of ideas, can we predict if a kickstarter will succeed at project launch? 

Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a kickstarter will succeed. This can help two audiences: the creators and the backers. Creators can use the model as a preliminary baseline to see if their proposed idea might succeed and tune their proposal to maximize success. Backers can use the model as a basis when deciding to "back" the creator ot not.

## Data Source
We are provided with 2 CSVs sourcing from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sripaadsrinivasan/kickstarter-campaigns-dataset.
This dataset contains data about failed, canceled, and successful kickstarter campaigns. For example, we analyze the timing of campaign posts, types of projects, and locations of campiagn and their descriptions.
